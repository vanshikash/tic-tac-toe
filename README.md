# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game implemented in React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Players can take turns marking spaces.
- Real-time winner detection: The game detects and announces the winner as soon as a winning condition is met.
- History tracking: The game tracks the history of moves, allowing players to review their previous moves.

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for the game logic.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the user interface.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshikash/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns clicking on empty squares to mark them with their symbol (either "X" or "O").
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.


## Future Scope
I will be working on adding additional features in this game soon.
